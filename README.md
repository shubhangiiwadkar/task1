This program helps a teacher or user analyze students' grades. When you run it, the program first asks how many students there are. Then, it asks you to enter each student's grade one by one. As you input the grades, the program stores them in a list called grades. After all the grades are entered, it goes through the list to calculate three things: the total average grade, the highest grade, and the lowest grade. To do this, it adds up all the grades and also keeps track of the highest and lowest ones it finds. Finally, it shows the average, highest, and lowest grades on the screen. This kind of program is useful for quickly getting an overview of how students are performing.
